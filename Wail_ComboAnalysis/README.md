# Wail_ComboAnalysis
 
## Introduction
This is a project to analyze combo data in this paper:

Computational pharmacogenomics screen identifies synergistic statin-compound combinations as anti-breast cancer therapies, 2020, Leeuwen et. al..

The script for the analysis is written in R.


----

## Dependencies:
These R packages need to be installed in order to run the analysis script:
- PharmacoGx
- magicaxis
- abind
- robustbase
- Biobase
- synergyfinder
- ComplexHeatmap
- circlize
- ggplot2
- ggpubr
- reshape
- snowfall
- GSA
- piano
- scales
- ggrepel
- dplyr
- tidyr
- BoutrosLab.plotting.general
- UpSetR


----
## Reproducibility of the Analysis:
- Inside the main directory, there is an R script file named "combo_analysis.R". Running this script will regenerate the combo data and analyses in this paper.

**Important Note:** the user needs to set the working directory inside the script file before running it, i.e. setting the working directory to "Wail_ComboAnalysis"
